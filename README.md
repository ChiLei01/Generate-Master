Generate-Monster

1. https://github.com/ChiLei01/Generate-Master
2. The app generate random monsters you can specify the type, challenge rate, size, languages and alignment
   by selecting them in the dropdownmenu. Once the monster has been generate you can save them to your list.
   In the list you can review your saved monsters and remove them.
   I didn't use any api's, but I have a jsonfile where the monsters have been stored.
